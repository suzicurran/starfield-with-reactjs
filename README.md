Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload to display changes if you make edits, including re-compiling Sass files to CSS on the fly.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
